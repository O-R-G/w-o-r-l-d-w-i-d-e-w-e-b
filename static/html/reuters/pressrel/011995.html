"It is," he explained, "aimed specifically at Wharton graduate or undergraduate students from Bermuda with an interest in business management, administration and the financial markets.  Bermuda is an important business community and financial market for the Southeast Business district.  This program will enable Reuters to show its appreciation and support to the Bermudian community by enabling study at a leading academic institution for academically talented students for whom the cost of tuition would otherwise be prohibitive." <P>The program, which will start September, 1995, will be administered by the Wharton School.  Wharton also receives a range of Reuters news and financial information products from Reuters, including market data. <P>The Bank of Bermuda has arranged for the Reuter Fellow to receive a summer internship at the Bank.  Charles Vaughan-Johnson, President and Chief Executive Officer of  The Bank of Bermuda, said, "The Bank of Bermuda is proud to support Reuters Fellowship program.  Our affiliation, in the form of an internship for the Fellowship recipient, augments the Bank's dedicated and ongoing community support and scholarship initiatives for young Bermudians.  Continuing education is the cornerstone of the Bank's customer service.  Accordingly, we are pleased to join as a partner in Reuters Fellowship program." <P>Dean Thomas P. Gerrity of The Wharton School said, "One of the Wharton School's great strengths is an internationally diverse student body.  This generous gift from Reuters America and The Reuter Foundation allows us to attract the most academically gifted and qualified students from Bermuda -- an area of growing importance." <P>The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania is one of the world's foremost institutions for business education.  Founded in 1881 as the nation's first collegiate school of management, Wharton has leading programs at the undergraduate, MBA, doctoral and executive education levels.
