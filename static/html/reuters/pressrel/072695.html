Revenue grew by 19% to £1,295 million (US$2,060 million) or by 16% excluding acquisitions made since the beginning of 1994.  At comparable exchange rates adjusted to exclude the effect of currency, revenue rose by 18% in the first six months.  Transaction products grew by 26% to £317 million (US$505 million) compared to 38% in the first half of 1994 and information products rose 17% to £904 million (US$1,438 million) compared to 19%.  Second quarter revenue growth was 16% at actual rates against 22% in the first quarter.  Information products slowed to 12% from 23% or 15% excluding acquisitions.<p>"Operating profit grew by 21% to £264 million (US$420 million) while the operating margin increased from 20.0% in the first half of 1994 to 20.4% in the same 1995 period.  Currency benefits from the recent weakness of sterling were partially offset by the effects of currency hedging.  Pre-tax profit grew by 17% to £288 million (US$458 million).  The margin at 22.2% compared with a margin of 22.5% in the first half of 1994.  A decline in the benefit from interest hedging was largely responsible for the reduction in the margin.  Cash grew to £607 million (US$965 million) from £534 million (US$849 million) at the end of 1994.<p>"Earnings per share (EPS) rose by 18% to 12.3 pence (US$1.17 per American Depositary Share, representing six ordinary shares).  The interim dividend of 2.3 pence is 21% above that of last year's 1.9 pence.<p>"We expect to see a slower rate of double-digit revenue growth in the second half of 1995 than that reported in the first six months of the year. This results from the lack of any once-off benefits from acquisitions and a new order level which has stabilised below the average for last year.  Market conditions are relatively uncertain and not currently good enough to assure us of continued double-digit revenue growth next year.  We are maintaining our focus on improving business efficiency to support our earnings growth.  We remain committed to the high levels of investment necessary to reinforce the product line, in particular our equities and fixed income product range.<p>"Transaction products, which enable traders to deal via a keyboard and screen, remained the fastest growing part of Reuters business.  Dealing 2000-2, the foreign exchange product which automatically matches the best bids and offers in the system, reached its target of 20,000 matches a day in June.  Dealing 2000-1, our conversational foreign exchange dealing service, reached a new record of 1.89 million conversations a week in March and for the second quarter recorded an average of 1.46 million conversations weekly, up 17.5% against the 1.24 million average in the same period last year.  Instinet, the equities trading subsidiary, continued to exceed one billion shares a month turnover increasing the number of user accesses to 5,200 from 4,400 at the beginning of the year.  Its revenue grew by 34% (41% at comparable rates) to £59 million (US$94 million) in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 1994.<p>"Total user accesses (see page 24) grew by 10% to 309,200, a rise of around 28,000 from a year ago and a gain of 12,500 from the end of 1994.  Sales of information management systems, which manage data flows around dealing rooms, rose by 60% to £93 million (US$148 million) compared to the first six months of 1994. They were assisted by an excellent performance from Teknekron Software Systems, Inc., a US software supplier and systems integrator acquired in March 1994.  Less than a year after its introduction in Europe where it is selling well, Reuters Financial Television went live in the United States and Japan.  This is a television service currently serving foreign exchange professionals in all the major time zones with timely market-moving coverage of key events on a daily basis." <p><i>Reuters, Reuter and the dotted logo are registered trademarks of Reuters Limited in more than 25 countries.<p></I></blockquote><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><nobr><a href="../index.html"><img src="../images/homey.gif" border=0></a><a href="index.html"><img src="../images/newsrel.gif" border=0></a><a href="../sitemap.html"><img src="../images/map.gif" border=0></a><a href="mailto:webeditor@reuters.com"><img src="../images/feedback.gif" border=0></a></nobr></body>
