It allows radio stations the opportunity to customize their news and information programming in an efficient and affordable manner.  Radio stations are provided with crisis coverage, bulletins and breaking news from around the world, including hourly news summaries, sports summaries and running scores, business news reports and stock market updates, entertainment reports, morning show prep material, local weather reports, advisories and instant warnings. <P>"We believe the alliance of ABC, Reuters and States News Service makes ABC NewsWire the best value radio stations across the country can buy.  Everything's included -- local, national, international and business news, as well as sports and weather," said Paul Eedle, Executive Vice President and Editor America, Reuters America Inc. <P>Reuters America Inc. is the chief operating division in the Americas of Reuters Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: RTRSY).
