These include insurance and reinsurance companies, Lloyd's syndicates and emerging markets. <P>The financial data which SAS will initially provide will relate to property/casualty insurance and reinsurance carriers worldwide.  The information will largely be obtained from annual reports and accounts and regulatory returns.  One of the hallmarks of the service will be the standardized presentation of data, including that on Lloyd's syndicates. <P>Sedgwick is currently working on other information products to be made available through the RIB service. Sax Riley, Chief Executive of Sedgwick Group plc and Chairman of Sedgwick Analysis Services Limited, said: "We believe that this service will be of considerable benefit to industry professionals and insurance buyers in their everyday needs.  Never before will so much information specific to our business be available at the press of a button.  Not only is this an exciting use of our existing skills base but it gives us the opportunity to participate in the fast-developing area of information distribution.  Sedgwick is delighted to be venturing into this new and complementary market with Reuters." <P>Peter Job, Chief Executive of Reuters Holdings PLC, said: "We are very pleased to be cooperating with Sedgwick in this way.  The differences in our skill sets and areas of knowledge complement each other.  The combination of our two companies, both global leaders in their respective fields, will allow us to develop jointly a sector which we believe offers growth potential." <P>In November 1994 Reuters established an international group in London to market and develop information services to the insurance industry. <P><i>Reuters, Reuter and the dotted logo are registered trademarks of Reuters Limited in more than 25 countries.</i> <P></blockquote><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><nobr><a href="../index.html"><img src="../images/homey.gif" border=0></a><a href="index.html"><img src="../images/newsrel.gif" border=0></a><a href="../sitemap.html"><img src="../images/map.gif" border=0></a><a href="mailto:webeditor@reuters.com"><img src="../images/feedback.gif" border=0></a></nobr></body>
