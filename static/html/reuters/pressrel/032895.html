The company's editorial presence here will enable it to expand its coverage of California's dynamic, high-technology industries and provide more in-depth reporting of the computer, software, semiconductor and multimedia companies located in the state. <P>"Opening a bureau in Palo Alto means we now have 21 in the United States," said Paul Eedle, Reuters Editor, America.  "We are determined to expand our coverage of American news and Silicon Valley is a logical next step in meeting this goal." <p>The new bureau is staffed by Palo Alto correspondent Susan Moran, who will work closely with newly appointed San Francisco specialist Barbara Grady, of Reuters San Francisco bureau, to broaden coverage in the area. <P>Both correspondents  transferred to the West Coast from Reuters U.S. financial reporting headquarters in New York. Susan Moran worked there most recently as an editor on the Reuter Business Report, which serves newspaper business pages.   Barbara Grady was Reuters telecommunications  specialist in New York during the industry's heavy merger period and recently spearheaded coverage of that industry on the New York desk . <P>Mike Armstrong, Vice President, Western District, Reuters America, said, "The opening of this bureau represents an ever-increasing involvement between Silicon Valley and Reuters.  The rapid growth of our information services to numerous firms in the Bay Area has made northern California particularly strategic to Reuters.
