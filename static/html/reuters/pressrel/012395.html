The server acts as an "information agent" on an organization's local area network and provides the capability to gather corporate intelligence from a vast array of Reuter and third-party sources.  Information from over 600 international publications (including newspapers, news wires, business journals and trade magazines) is delivered alongside share prices, stock indices and foreign exchange rates. <P>With RBA's simple user interface, organizations can set up pre-defined information "profiles."  At specified times throughout the day, these profiles are updated to the RBA Server.  In effect, this provides an organization with the tools to produce its own, self-updating, personalized electronic briefings. <P>Each profile maintained on an RBA Server can be linked to a Lotus Notes database, allowing users to view information in a variety of ways including: news-by-date, company, industry, country, and topic; and prices by portfolio or individual instrument. <P>The RBA Server runs under IBM'S OS/2 operating system but can deliver files to Notes servers running on different platforms. <P>Anthony Allday,  Product Marketing Manager, Business Information Products, said: "More and more companies, realizing the importance of sharing information to further their corporate business aims, are implementing networked information systems.  Increasingly they are looking for external soft data to integrate with, and complement, their internal hard data.  They need competitor, market supplier and general industry information, and they need it updated frequently, throughout the day.  Reuter Business Alert for Lotus Notes provides precisely that. <P>"Reuters chose to develop Lotus Notes connectivity because we found that increasingly  organizations were investing in Notes as a groupware standard.  We have been testing the product at client sites throughout Europe, North America and Asia and are confident that it satisfies a growing market need." <P>Commenting on the announcement, Jeff Papows, Vice President, Communications Products Division, Lotus Development Corporation, said: "The replication, security and agent technology of Lotus Notes makes it an ideal environment for electronic information publishing, which is one of our fastest growing markets.  We are delighted that Reuters has chosen to deliver the Reuter Business Alert service through Lotus Notes.  This new service will add great value to our existing and future Lotus Notes customers, and is further evidence of the industry that is rapidly forming around Lotus Notes." <P> RBA for Lotus Notes is priced at a fixed monthly rate which is calculated according to the number of users per organization. <P>Reuters Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RTRSY) supplies the global business community and news media with a wide range of products including real-time financial data, transaction systems, access to numerical and textual historical databases, news, graphics, still photos and news video.  Reuter Group companies design and install trading room systems.  Information is obtained from around 210 exchanges and over-the-counter markets, from  4,120 subscribers who contribute data directly to Reuters, and from a network of about 1,470 journalists, photographers and cameramen.  Some 281,200 clients access Reuter information, some using their own terminals to do so. <P><i>Reuters is a trademark of Reuters Limited.<p>Lotus and Lotus Notes are registered trademarks and Notes is a trademark of Lotus Development Corporation.<p>IBM and OS/2 are trademarks of International Business Machines Corporation. </i><p></blockquote><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><nobr><a href="../index.html"><img src="../images/homey.gif" border=0></a><a href="index.html"><img src="../images/newsrel.gif" border=0></a><a href="../sitemap.html"><img src="../images/map.gif" border=0></a><a href="mailto:webeditor@reuters.com"><img src="../images/feedback.gif" border=0></a></nobr></body>
