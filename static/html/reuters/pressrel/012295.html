Reuters, the oldest and largest international news operation, with 126 bureaus worldwide, will provide 24-hour international coverage to the service.  Fox and Reuters reporters and camera crews will cover national stories.  Fox stations and affiliates will provide coverage of breaking news in their own areas to the service.<p>"Fox stations will gain direct access to a news operation second to none," said Evans.  "This will help our affiliates that carry news to maintain their news presence in their markets as well as make it possible for affiliates not carrying news to do so."<p>Eedle said, "This agreement brings the unrivaled world news coverage of Reuters to the millions of people watching America's fastest-growing television broadcaster.  It also creates a new source for television news coverage of the United States."<p>The service will be based at Reuters Washington, D.C. bureau, also the headquarters of the 39 Reuters news bureaus in the Americas.  <p>Under the agreement, Reuters will provide the technical infrastructure and news gathering expertise to the service.  Fox Television will provide editorial direction and input of affiliate wants and needs.<p>Initially, the service will provide three full-fledged news feeds, but is expected to expand later in the year.  A team of reporters and camera crews based in Washington, D.C., will focus on national political news.  A second team, based in New York, will cover other breaking national events.  An assignment desk in Washington will organize and coordinate the exchange of news between affiliates and receive international news feeds from Reuters.<p>Affiliate correspondents will have access to Reuters Washington studio and live spots to provide their own coverage of events in the nation's capital.<p><i>Reuters is a trademark of Reuters Limited</i><p></blockquote><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><nobr><a href="../index.html"><img src="../images/homey.gif" border=0></a><a href="index.html"><img src="../images/newsrel.gif" border=0></a><a href="../sitemap.html"><img src="../images/map.gif" border=0></a><a href="mailto:webeditor@reuters.com"><img src="../images/feedback.gif" border=0></a></nobr></body>
