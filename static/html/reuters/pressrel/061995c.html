The agreement allows Reuters to use Multex Publisher as a means of collecting research documents and distributing them over the global Reuter communications network. <p>Multex Publisher is a software package that enables brokers and other investment professionals to distribute research documents electronically throughout their branch offices, as well as to their retail and institutional clients.  Subject to entitlements specified by the research provider, customers can view documents on their desk-top screens in the original format, including graphic images and even photographs. <P>Under the agreement, Reuter customers will have access to documents collected by Multex, and similarly Multex customers will have access to documents collected by Reuters. <P>Portfolio managers and other users of the service can search for financial research documents online, and select the reports they wish to view by business sector, company, broker, analyst or even key words, and can be alerted to the arrival of new material of interest to them. <P>"Reuter customers around the world have long been asking us to help solve their problems in the distribution and management of broker research documents," said Jeremy Penn, International Marketing Director, Equities, Reuters Limited.  "We believe that the combination of Multex Publisher and the worldwide reach of our communications network will enable us to provide the best available document management technology." <P>Multex Systems pioneered the use of on-line information systems to publish financial research reports in electronic, graphical format. Multex gathers research information from contributing research firms and creates structured, full-text document databases.  Multex Systems receives the information, processes it, and redistributes it electronically to entitled subscribers within minutes after research analysts release their reports. <P>"This agreement with Reuters is a significant advance for Multex Systems. Our global distribution strategy is to publish research documents electronically through major strategic partners such as Reuters that reach the widest spectrum of investment decision makers," said Isaak Karaev, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Multex Systems, Inc. <P>Multex Systems was founded in 1992 to develop and market Multex Publisher.  The on-line service currently has over 30,000 research reports available from 50 brokerage, investment banking and independent research firms and is growing at over 1,500 new reports per week.  Multex has received $8 million of capital investment from AT&T Ventures, ADP, R.R. Donnelley and Euclid Partners. <P>Reuters America is the chief operating division in the Americas of Reuters Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: RTRSY).  Reuters supplies the global business community and news media with a wide range of products, including real-time financial data, transaction systems, access to numerical and textual historical databases, news, graphics, still photos and news video.
