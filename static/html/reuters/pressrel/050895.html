This month, BrightStar is carrying two weeks of trans-Atlantic broadcasts of Good Morning America from a variety of locations throughout Europe.  BrightStar is supporting Good Morning America broadcasts from a number of European cities as the morning news and entertainment show commemorates the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. <P>"We have worked with BrightStar on similar projects over the years, " said Michael Andrisani, Manager, Network Traffic Operations, ABC Television Network.  "We've already been on site surveys with BrightStar location specialists who are extremely knowledgeable about each city from where we are broadcasting.  BrightStar knows well the European regulatory requirements, and is expert with technical planning and managing the transmissions.  We look forward to two weeks of quality broadcasting that will be as successful as our past joint efforts with BrightStar have been." <P>According to Paul Eedle, Editor and Senior Vice President, Reuters America Inc.: "BrightStar has the unique ability to provide necessary resources including satellite capacity, technology, equipment and personnel -- on both sides of the Atlantic -- to ensure that the two-week European schedule for Good Morning America is a successful project for ABC Television." <P>The transmissions began on Monday, May 1, and will air daily through May 12. BrightStar is supporting Good Morning America by providing ABC throughout its European tour with three dedicated transportable earth stations.  BrightStar is providing one earth station at the primary locations where hosts Joan Lundon and Charlie Gibson are anchoring the show, and a second at a remote location where weatherman Spencer Christian is filing reports from the field.  Remote location feeds are being sent back to the day's primary broadcast site for live insertions into the program.  A third earth station will be utilized as backup and on alternate days drive on to the next day's primary broadcast site. <P>BrightStar is carrying the transmissions via its dedicated transponders on Intelsat K, which covers Europe and the Americas.  The signals are being downlinked in New York City for final delivery to the ABC Broadcast Center.  In addition, the ABC off-air network feed is being re-sent to the primary location in Europe, via BrightStar, for monitoring and to various European broadcasters for airing. <P>BrightStar, one of the leading providers of international satellite transmission services in the world, provides regular and special event transmissions and has built a wide range of satellite management services for its customers.
