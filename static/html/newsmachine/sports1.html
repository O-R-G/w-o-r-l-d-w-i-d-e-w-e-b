Jim Bunning, a former big league pitchingstar, called Major League Baseball a monopoly whose exemption from anti-monopolylaws should be repealed.<p>Bunning, R-Ken., in a House floor speech, rebutted a letter to Congressmen fromacting baseball commissioner Bud Selig defending the exemption from anti-trustlaws by arguing it did not make organized baseball a cartel. <p>"The anti-trust exemption shields Major League Baseball from market forces andmakes competiton impossible," Bunning said. "That sounds like monopoly to me."<p>Bunning has introduced legislation to repeal the exemption as it applies tolabor relations. Other legislation has been introduced to repeal the anti-monopoly exemption completely.<p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1995.
