Up to 3,000would remain as part of a U.N. force of about 6,000 troops after March. <p>"The term 'safe and secure' is a relative term, of course," Perry told reportersTuesday, five days after a U.S. soldier was shot to death in an exchange ofgunfire with the driver of pickup truck in Haiti. <p>"Any city in the United States, any city anywhere in the world is subject torandom and isolated violence," he added before a meeting with British ForeignMinister Douglas Hurd. "There has been some of that in Haiti, but on a relativescale, yes, I would say it is safe and secure." <p>Defence Department spokesman Ken Bacon later told reporters that the UnitedNations expects to take over the Haiti operation from the United States duringthe last two weeks in March.<p>"Our assumption is now that the UNMI (U.N. Mission in Haiti) force will takeover probably in the last two weeks of March, by March 31st. That's the jointplan," said Bacon.<p>He said U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was expected to submitdocuments to the Security Council Wednesday "saying that Haiti is now a secureand stable environment" for a turnover to U.N. control. <p>The Security Council within a week will adopt a resolution spelling out conditions for UNMI, which will have up to 6,000 troops, about half of themdrawn from the current U.S.-led force. More than 2,000 are expected to be Americans.<p>The new U.N. force commander is U.S. Army Major General Joseph Kinzer. LakhdarBrahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister, will be the civilian U.N. chief ofthe operation.<p>Bacon told reporters that Kinzer and Brahimi were currently in Haiti and wouldremain there until Friday for meetings, including talks with Aristide. <p>An Army Special Forces sergeant became the first U.S. soldier killed in Haitilast Thursday in an exchange of gunfire with the driver of a pickup truck thatdrove past a tollbooth without stopping. <p>A second American soldier was wounded and a Haitian civilian was killed in theincident in Gonaives, a town about 106 miles (170 km) from the Haitian capitalof Port-au-Prince.<p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1995.
