(Long LiveClinton!).<p>Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo struck an up-beat note, saying Mexico's liquidity crisis was now "fully overcome". <p>But U.S. officials took a more sombre view, saying Mexico had been standing atthe brink of the abyss before Clinton announced the bail-out package. <p>"The situation was dire in Mexico," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said."There was the risk of default (on loans) and the problems that that wouldinvolve for not only Mexico but for the United States and for the world economy."<p>Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz later denied Mexico had considered suspendingdebt payments.<p>The U.S. president, aware of the urgency of Mexico's situation, scrapped plansto try and force up to $40 billion in loan guarantees for Mexico through Congress. Instead he announced a reduced U.S. credit line of $20 billion thatwill not require Congressional approval. <p>He said the U.S. contribution would be in addition to an enhanced credit line of$17.5 billion from the International Monetary Fund and a "short-term lendingfacility" of $10 billion from the Bank of International Settlements. <p>Ortiz said Mexico's credit lines from abroad now added up to $50.76 billion, andthe U.S. component could now be paid back over 3-10 years instead of 3-6 monthsas previously.<p>He added that a $3 billion commercial bank package for Mexico, not included inthe Clinton plan, should also be ready very soon. <p>A sense of euphoria mingled with relief rippled through Mexican markets, sendinginterest rates lower as the stock market soared and the peso recovered. <p>"People cheered up a lot in the market with the announcement of the economic aidbecause the fate of the credit was what had provoked all the uncertainty," onestock market trader said.<p>Ortiz said Mexico believed the peso was now "very undervalued" and would strengthen against the dollar.<p>Clinton spoke to Zedillo from aboard Air Force One and urged him to stick to astrong, credible economic programme as well as honour previous commitmentsregarding immigration, law enforcement and narcotics control. <p>Zedillo, in his statement, pledged no slackening of fiscal discipline. <p>"The financial package that was announced this morning means that the liquidityproblem in the Mexican economy is fully overcome," he said. "The financialpackage in no way implies the slackening of our own efforts." <p>He said the credits would be used to exchange high-cost short-term debt forlonger-term, cheaper borrowing, and that Mexico's overall foreign debt had notincreased.<p>The Mexican central bank, which had been facing a potentially difficult auctionthis week of its dollar-denominated Tesobono securities, decided simply todeclare the auction void after Clinton announced the new deal. <p>"We stopped the auction after Clinton's remarks," a Banco de Mexico spokesmantold Reuters.<p>Investors had asked for sky-high interest rates of up to 40 percent to covertheir risk in buying Tesobonos, the securities that are at the heart of Mexico'ssix-week-old economic crisis because of fears that the government might not beable to repay them.<p>Ortiz told reporters the government was going ahead with existing schemes tooffer investors alternatives to their dollar-denominated Tesobono holdings. <p>Mexico's crisis broke Dec. 20 when Zedillo's fledgling government devalued thenew peso and then let it float on world markets. It took the action because ofdeclining confidence that Mexico could sustain a rocketing trade and currentaccount deficit with the rest of the world. <p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1995.
