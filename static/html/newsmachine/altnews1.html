He really couldn't believe hisluck. The Americans thought he was a spy but he told them he was just doing itfor fun," the hacker told the Independent. <p>The boy, nicknamed "Datastream" by other Internet users, was finally caught byspecial U.S. investigators because he left his terminal on-line to a U.S. defence computer overnight.<p>British police arrested the boy in July and prosecutors are expected to decidethis month whether he can be charged, the Independent said. <p>In a statement to the paper, the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigationsacknowledged the hacker could have accessed and read the Korean files. <p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1995.
