Inc. to PepsiCo, McDonalds Corp. andChrysler Corp., companies are geared up for the year's most hyped sporting --and advertising -- event.<p>"A lot of people think it's just a football game, but it's also the Super Bowlof advertising," said James Beardsley, president of padlock maker and long-timeSuper Bowl advertiser Master Lock. "That's a competition we'd like to win." <p>For companies seeking a really big audience, this is it. <p>"It's consistently the highest-rated, most-watched television programme on anynetwork throughout the year," said Janice Gretemeyer, spokeswoman for the ABCnetwork, which is carrying this year's championship game between the San Francisco 49ers and the San Diego Chargers at Miami on Jan. 29. <p>"Last year 123.2 million people tuned in to all or part of the game," Gretemeyersaid. That's nearly four times the number of people who watch the most popularweekly series, ABC's "Home Improvement," which draws about 33 million. <p>But what does it take to keep all those hungry and thirsty Super Bowl viewersfrom running to the refrigerator during your million-dollar commercial? <p>"It's got to be unique, for starters," Pepsi-Cola North America President CraigWeatherup said in an interview. "If it's not unique, it's not going to getanywhere."<p>The soft drink giant won raves for its commercials last year -- particularly onewith a Pepsi-drinking chimp escaping a lab and driving off to the beach -- andclearly hopes for a repeat of that success with a whole new package of quirkyads this year.<p>Pepsi has put together a slew of commercials that put an odd twist on familiarsettings but are tied together with the theme, "Nothing Else is a Pepsi." <p>But advertisers run the risk of trying so hard to keep viewers glued to thescreen that the message gets lost, said Jack Trout of Greenwich, Conn.-basedmarketing strategy firm Trout & Partners. <p>Trout said many companies are likely to have spent as much producing their SuperBowl commercial as for the air time.<p>"Some advertisers can lose their way in trying to out-entertain each other,"added Bob Lachky, vice president of Budweiser brands for St. Louis-based Anheuser Busch.<p>While the two teams fight it out on the field, advertisers will be using strategies from tried-and-true campaigns to brand new ideas to win viewers'attention.<p>Among those bringing back familiar campaigns are Master Lock, with a bulletstriking one of its padlocks, and Budweiser's Bud Bowl game between Bud and BudLight bottles.<p>But Budweiser, which estimates its spending for Super Bowl advertising, productions and retail tie-ins at about $15 million, is scaling back its BudBowl to just one 60-second spot.<p>The St. Louis-based brewer plans to use its seven remaining spots to promote itsBudweiser and Bud Light brands -- already the No. 1 and 2 beers in the UnitedStates -- with new ads.<p>"It's a huge investment, but it's a great way for us to kick off our year,"Lachky said.<p>Chrysler, which last year used the Super Bowl to introduce its bubble-shapedNeon subcompact, plans to use this game to debut its new Dodge Stratus four-doorsedan.<p>Athletic footwear company Nike Inc. plans an expanded, 90-second version of itsspots featuring actor Dennis Hopper as rabid sports fan Stanley Craver, who willair his views on the game of football.<p>While this year's game is an all-California affair, Gretemeyer said that is notlikely to affect viewership.<p>"The Super Bowl is an event on television no matter who play," she said. <p>Strong economic growth has made the advertising market especially strong anddriven the price for a 30-second spot up 11 percent from last year's $900,000.<p>All told, industry sources expect ABC, a subsidiary of media company CapitalCities/ABC, to bring in some $75 million worth of advertising for the SuperBowl, including pre- and post-game coverage. <p>"These are record prices, and we expect to generate record revenues from thegame," Gretemeyer said.<p>"There are sixty, 30-second units within the game. All but two are sold out,"Gretemeyer said Wednesday.<p>"We fully expect to be sold out" by kick-off time, she said. <p><p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1995.
