"He wants the world to know that IBM does $11billion in software business."<p>But analysts are skeptical that IBM's software business can really become one ofits growth engines for the future, unless the company plans to develop an applications business.<p>As part of the reorganization plan, Gerstner formed an IBM software group andnamed John Thompson, an IBM senior vice president, to its helm. Thompson is oneof the executives credited with the turnaround in the company's mainframe operations and Gerstner hopes he will turn around software. <p>But a big chunk of IBM's software business comes from its proprietary mainframesoftware business, where it sells operating systems, database software, toolsand other programs to IBM mainframe computer customers. Analysts estimate thatslightly under $7 billion in software revenues are related to mainframes. Therest comes from PCs, minis and workstations. <p>While mainframe computers have been rebounding in the past year, they do notrepresent a growth engine for IBM. The growth potential is in PC software, whereIBM's biggest entry is its OS/2 Warp operating system. <p>But Milton of Brown Brothers said "It's too late for OS/2." He said he does notbelieve Warp will ever become a serious challenge to Microsoft Corp's dominanceon the desktop with DOS/Windows. "My advice to them would be if you want toraise your profile in software you get into the areas of higher growth and thatis the applications side." Applications are programs like word processors orspreadsheets.<p>IBM's new structure moves the networking hardware segment to servers and bringsall the software together so IBM can focus on growth areas. Proprietary operating systems for mainframe and minicomputers will remain with their hardware businesses.<p>The move to unify sales under one executive, Ned Lautenbach, is eliminating anold IBM concept of the World Trade division, which referred to everything outside North America. Analysts were surprised by the abrupt resignation ofLaBant, who was passed over to head up worldwide sales. LaBant was offeredanother job within IBM, but he decided to leave. <p>"The frustrating thing here is that he is shaking up management but he is usinginternal people," said Curt Rohrman, a First Boston analyst. "He continues toshift the bodies around around on the ship and they face some pretty difficultproblems."<p>The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that more IBM top executives could be ontheir way out, as the impatient Gerstner seeks to avoid a return to complacencyand arrogance amid a dramatic financial comeback. The paper said that chiefstrategist James Cannavino is on thin ice and Lee Reiswig, who heads up OS/2,could be next to go. IBM declined to comment. <p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1995.
