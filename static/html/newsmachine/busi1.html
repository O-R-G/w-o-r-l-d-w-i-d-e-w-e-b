A person familiar with the talkstold the paper GTE vice chairman Michael Masin has met with Brazilian officialsseeking approval for GTE to invest there. <p>Growth in the U.S. phone business is slowing and GTE is looking to expand uponthe international revenues, which make up only 13 percent of its revenues lastyear, the paper said. Total 1994 revenues were not yet posted. <p>GTE earned $990 million in 1993 on sales of $19.7 billion. -- New York newsdesk-- 212 859-1610 Equities<p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1995.
