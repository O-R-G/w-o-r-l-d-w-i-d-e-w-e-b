Security Council could force reimposition of the sanctions if Serbia does not fulfil its commitments. <p>He also said Serbia would not be readmitted to the Organisation for Security andCooperation in Europe and other international groups and would not be eligiblefor International Monetary Fund assistance or be exempted from war crimes tribunal prosecution.<p>Contact group members, who discussed the offer on Tuesday in Paris, had beenworking against the clock to try new peacemaking efforts in Bosnia. <p></blockquote><!-- Remote Tool Bar><center><pre><a href="NwsMch.html#front"><img src="front.gif" align=middle border=0></a>    <a href="nws.html"><img src="news.gif" align=middle border=0></a>  <a href="bsnss.html"><img src="busi.gif" align=middle border=0></a>  <a href="sprts.html"><img src="sports.gif" align=middle border=0></a>  <a href="altnws.html"><img src="altnews.gif" align=middle border=0></a> <a href="default.html"><img src="newsse.gif" align=middle border=0></a>  <a href="mynws.html"><img src="mynews.gif" align=middle border=0></a>  <a href="nwstk.html"><img src="newstk.gif" align=middle border=0></a>   <a href="sitemap.html"><img src="sitemap.gif" align=middle border=0></a></pre></center></BODY></HTML>
