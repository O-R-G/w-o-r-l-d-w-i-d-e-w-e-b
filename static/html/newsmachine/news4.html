He also said precedent calls for it to namean outside counsel to probe the charges. <p>A spokesman for Gingrich, Tony Blankley, dismissed the complaint. He told Reuters that "it appears Mr. Jones, whom Newt thrashed in the election, isfeasting on a bunch of sour grapes." He added that Jones has established "apattern of filing frivolous ethics complaints against Newt" and expects more "asMr. Jones' creative juices flow from time to time." <p>Jones, an actor who played "Cooter" the bumpkin auto mechanic on the TV series"Dukes of Hazzard," had served two terms in Congress from Georgia until 1992. Hetried a political comeback last November in Gingrich's congressional districtbut Gingrich crushed him in the November election. <p>Last September, Jones asked the ethics committee to investigate allegationsGingrich improperly used official House resources and violated tax law to finance a college course Gingrich teaches in Georgia, a course Jones said wasdesigned to advance Gingrich's partisan political goals. <p>But that complaint went unresolved by the ethics committee in the prior Democratic-controlled Congress. Like then, the ethics committee makeup is splitbetween Republicans, who now control Congress for the first time in 40 years,and Democrats with seven members each.<p>Jones' new, amended complaint charges Gingrich "has violated House rules, statutes and standards of conduct" and extends to a book arrangement betweenGingrich and HarperCollins, a publishing firm controlled by media magnate RupertMurdoch.<p>The book deal has caused a furore since it became public in December. At firstGingrich was to have received a $4.5 million advance from the publisher who hadbid for rights to publish two of Gingrich's books. <p>After critics said it appeared Gingrich was putting his high office on the blockto the highest bidder, Gingrich rejected the advance and said he would acceptthe normal 15 percent of the book sales in royalties. <p>Jones said Murdoch has substantial business matters pending before the government and his control of the Fox TV network is being challenged by NBC. Hetook Gingrich to task for quietly meeting with Murdoch and a Murdoch lobbyistNov. 28. Both Gingrich and Murdoch's spokesman have denied anything improperabout the discussions.<p>But Jones said the book arrangement is "inconsistent with the responsibilitiesof the full-time responsibilities of holding high public office." <p>Other charges levied by Jones include allegations Gingrich improperly solicitedcorporate funds to buy copies of tapes from his college course and intervenedimproperly with the Food and Drug Administration on behalf of a firm promoting ahome testing kit for AIDS.<p>"Many questions surrounding Mr. Gingrich's political empire and his co-minglingof official, political, educational and publishing ventures need to be scrutinised and they need to be put to rest," Jones said at a news conference.<p>"Taken together, they show a clear pattern of disingenuous disrespect for thismanual," he said, holding up the House ethics manual. <p>"Mr. Gingrich's actions represent clear violations of the rules of the house andthe ethics manual."<p>The ethics committee can recommend the House take action against members ofcongress for violation of House rules on standards of conduct, ranging fromreprimands to even expulsion from Congress. <p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1995.
