Unexpectedly strongeconomic growth and a blowout in the current account deficit forced the move. <p>Using the government's May 1994 estimate for the expected deficit in 1995/96 ofA$9.8 billion, economists saw a deficit in that year of A$4-8 billion after theeffects of strong growth, but before any new fiscal tightening is taken intoeffect.<p>This is known as the starting point deficit. <p>Given expected budget cuts of A$2-3 billion, this gives an expected final deficit of A$2-5 billion in 1995/96.<p>Economists said that despite its rhetoric of recent days, the government will beforced to reap most of the budget cuts by hiking taxes. <p>"Our view is that the government will be doing well in the medium term to keepspending to currently projected levels, let alone doing better," said BankersTrust senior economist Rory Robertson.<p>The government has already built spending restraint into its forecasts, projecting real spending increases of less than a percent a year for the comingthree years.<p>The government's tax hike options are severely constrained by the oppositionparties' control of the upper house of parliament and by the prospect of anelection in the next 12 to 14 months at the most. <p>The tax options seen most likely, given the opposition of the Green Parties andleft-leaning Australian Democrats to widespread new income or indirect taxes,include;<p>- a one to three percent tax surcharge on annual incomes over 38,000, raisingA$1 billion annually,<p>- a tax on domestic carbon dioxide emissions of A$1.25 per tonne of emmissions,<p>- the widening of indirect sales taxes to include some services like hotel roomsand restaurant meals, and,<p>- a higher wholesales sales tax.<p>A table follows with estimates of how the 1995/96 budget deficit will be reached. The starting point has been calculated using the May 1994 estimate ofA$9.8 billion and subtracting A$2 billion for the Qantas and some amount forstronger growth.<p>A$ bln Starting point Budget cuts Deficit <p>Bankers Trust	6-7	2-3	3-4<p>Citibank	5.8	2.8	3.0<p>Macquarie	8.0	3.0	5.0<p>SBNSW	4.8	2.0	2.8<p>Dresdner	4.8	2.0	2.75<p>National Farmers Fed	6.5	2.0	4.5<p>-- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730<p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1995.
