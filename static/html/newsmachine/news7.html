"It's unfair and un-American." <p>He said computer dealers are particularly irritated because they will be expected to sell the Windows 95 upgrade, which then could undermine future salesof hardware and software.<p>A spokesman for Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft said the dealers' concerns werepremature.<p>"This is a product that hasn't even been launched yet in a market that is stillso nascent that it's difficult to speculate what the ramifications are," saidspokesman Greg Shaw.<p>But given Microsoft's dominance in the industry and the expected huge success ofWindows 95, it's not surprising that the Microsoft Network has attracted a lotof attention.<p>Shortly after official announcement of the service, cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. took a 20 percent stake for $125 million, giving it anindicated value of $600 million before a single customer signed up. <p>America Online Inc. has been most prominent among critics of the planned network, contending Microsoft will have a built-in edge because users will beable to access the service with the click of a Windows 95 icon. <p>Microsoft officials respond that rival companies including America Online already bundle free software with computers, and the ultimate decision aboutwhether to pay for an on-line service belongs to the customer. <p>Weinberger said his group was asked to provide information for the JusticeDepartment's antitrust investigation of Microsoft's proposed $1.5 billion acquisition of personal finance software company Intuit Inc. <p>The group initially declined to participate but decided to bring forward itsconcerns about the on-line network after Microsoft announced the support fromhardware and software companies.<p>"We have no problem if this network would just be an information network,"Weinberger said. "The problem is once you get into computer sales." <p>Microsoft stock ended the day unchanged at $62 on the Nasdaq system, whileIntuit fell 75 cents to $68.<p>Analysts say it is far from certain whether the Justice Department will letMicrosoft buy Intuit, maker of the leading personal-finance software Quicken. <p>Shaw said Microsoft is continuing to provide information about the proposedacquisition to the Justice Department.<p><p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1995.
