Click Search, and a list of titles linked to articles in Reuters NewsMachine will appear.<p>Boolean operators may be used in either type of search.  The Boolean operatorsare AND OR NOT ADJ.  Here are some examples of their use:<pre>       <strong>Kohl AND ECU</strong> finds articles containing both words.       <strong>Oil OR Petroleum</strong> finds articles containing either word.       <strong>Election NOT California</strong> finds articles containing the first word       but not the second.               <strong>Weather ADJ Boston ADJ November</strong> finds articles containing "Weather"       followed immediately by "Boston", followed immediately by "November"               <strong>Simpson AND (law OR legal)</strong> finds articles containing the first       term in combination with the second or third term.</pre><p>We recommend that search queries be entered in lowercase letters.<p>In Reuters NewsMachine, the WAIS search engine ignores common words such as "do and "in" (known as "stopwords"), along with punctuation (such as question marks and periods), and checks the remaining words against its index of articles. The program then returns a list of articles that are ranked according to the search engine's analysis of their relevance to the query. The end of the list also contains a report that shows how your query was interpreted by the search engine.</blockquote><hr><br><br><br><br><blockquote><a name="questions"><h2> Detailed Tips about Searching</h2><h3>Natural Language Search</h3>The server can be queried using natural language questions.The server does not understand the question, rather it takesthe words and phrases in the question and finds documentsthat have those words and phrases in them. "Tell me aboutportable computers." is an example of a natural languagequestion.  In this example, the WAIS server would search fordocuments containing the words 'portable' and 'computers';the other words, 'tell', 'me', and 'about', are called "stopwords" -- words so common that they occur in almost everydocument and so they are not used for searching a document.<p><h3>Literal Strings</h3>A similar but more specific kind of query asks to finddocuments that contain one or more exact phrases byenclosing them in double quotation marks. This is known as aliteral. For example, the query<p><pre>  <strong>"search engine capabilities"</strong></pre><p>returns only documents that contain this exact phrase.The WAIS search engine performs a literal search exactly asif you had used the boolean operator ADJ. Thus the aboveexample would yield the same results as<p><pre>  <strong>search ADJ engine ADJ capabilities</strong></pre><p>For this reason, it is best to stick to noun phrases whenusing literals; if your literal phrase includes stopwords,the stopwords will be ignored.<p><h3>Boolean Operators</h3>The boolean operators, AND, OR, NOT, and ADJ aid inestablishing logical relationships between conceptsexpressed in natural language. These operators areespecially useful in narrowing down the search.<p><strong>AND, &amp;&amp;</strong><p><pre>     The AND operator is helpful in restricting a search     when a particular pair or larger group of terms is     known. For instance, when searching for documents on     the weather in Boston, a question such as "weather AND     Boston" would return only those documents that contain     both the word "weather" and the word "Boston". You can     use more than one AND in a query, e.g.  "weather AND     Boston AND November". Note that the C-like double     ampersand (&amp;&amp;) may be used instead of spelling out the     word AND.</pre><p>     <strong>OR, ||</strong><p><pre>     The OR operator is often used to join two different     phrases of a Boolean search. A question such as     "hurricane OR tornado" would search for all documents     containing either the word "hurricane", or the word     "tornado", or both. You can also use more than one OR     in a query.  A natural language question is much like     having an implicit OR between the words, except that     the search engine does more work in a natural language     query to determine the relevance of words and their     relationships in a phrase.  Note that the C-like double     vertical bars (||) may be used instead of spelling out     the word OR.</pre><p>     <strong>NOT</strong><p><pre>     NOT is a binary operator. That is, it has to come     between two or more words or parenthesized clauses. NOT     is used to reject any documents that contain certain     words. The question "basketball NOT college" would find     all documents containing the word "basketball", that do     not also contain the word "college".  Note, however,     that this question would eliminate articles on any     professional players that mention their alma maters; in     other words, be careful not to limit your search too     much with the NOT operator, make sure that you know     what you're throwing away.</pre><p>     Don't be afraid to use NOT!  One good search strategy is tosearch for a broadly occurring term and get lots ofdocuments you don't want, and then to use NOT to filter outthe bad documents.  For example, if you're trying to cookokra, you might search for "cooking AND okra" and findnothing; but if you search for "cooking", you find lots ofarticles on cooking meats and pastas.  You then can searchfor "cooking NOT meat NOT pasta", and you might find moreinteresting articles that eventually lead you to your goal.Another handy trick is to use NOT to "break the 40 barrier".Typical WAIS clients only display 40 documents, but if youuse NOT wisely, you can flush out the documents you don'tlike in those 40 and progressively refine your search,adding better and better documents to the 40 that you see.<p><strong>ADJ</strong><p><pre>     The adjacent operator, ADJ, is used to ensure that one     word is followed by another in the returned document,     with no other words in between. For example, "cordless     ADJ telephone" returns only documents containing     "cordless telephone" and ignores documents that only     contain one of the words or that contain both but not     adjacent to one another. ADJ will nonetheless work when     stopwords interrupt two words; for example, the     preceding example will find occurrences of "cordless     for telephone". Note that the ADJ operator yields the     same results as does a literal query. Also note that     ADJ, unlike AND, OR, and NOT, is not a commutative     property - "telephone ADJ cordless" does not work the     same as "cordless ADJ telephone".</pre>     <p><h3>Mixing Natural Language, Literals, And Booleans</h3>The ability to mix natural language, literals, and booleanoperators is unique to the WAISserver search engine.Combining natural language and boolean operators enables endusers to better target their searches. For example, supposeyou were looking for documents specifically on portablelaptop computers that are not made by Tosuji Corporation.The question could then be "Tell me about portable laptopcomputers NOT Tosuji."<p><h3>Fielded Search</h3>For data sets whose documents have special data fields,selected portions of the documents can be tagged by the WAISparser as fields. A client can then ask a WAIS server tolimit its search to those documents containing a user-specified value of a particular field. This is called afielded search.<p>The mail-or-rmail parse format is an example of a parseformat in which fields are tagged. For this parse format,the WAIS parser detects the "to" and "cc" fields, the "from"and "sender" fields, the "subject" field, and the "date"field. An example of a question using natural language, aboolean operator, and fielded search is: "company picnic ANDfrom=barbara". The WAIS server would then find emailmessages about a company picnic that Barbara sent.<p><h3>Date and Numeric Ranges</h3>For a date or numeric field, a range may be specified usingthe syntax<p><pre>  <strong>field-name    comparison-operator    value</strong></pre><p>where comparison-operator may be one of &gt; (greater than),&lt; (less than), &gt;= (greater than or equal to), &lt;= (less thanor equal to), or = (equal to).<p>Currently, dates with the following formats are supported:<p><pre>               <strong> m-d-yy    m-d-yyyy    mm-dd-yy              m/d/yy    mm/dd/yy    m.d.yy              today     yesterday</strong></pre><p>Only positive integers are supported for numeric fields.If the comparison operator is =, then the range may bespecified using the word TO, as in<p><pre>           <strong>date = 4/15/93 TO 4/14/94</strong></pre><p>Both ends of the range are inclusively specified.<p><h3>Right Truncation (Wildcards)</h3>A user can specify right truncation by ending a word withthe asterisk (*) wild card character.  This tells the searchengine to search on words whose first several charactersmatch the base characters before the *.  For example, youmight use right truncation in a question such as geo*, whichmay retrieve documents containing the words: geographer,geography, geologist, geometry, geometrical, etc.<p><h3>Grouping Search Terms</h3>A user can group search terms and phrases together usingparentheses.<p>For example, if you wish to search for information aboutsnowstorms, tornadoes, or hurricanes in New York City, youmight search for "(snowstorms OR tornadoes OR hurricanes)AND (New ADJ York ADJ City)." You can also nest yourparentheses; for example, "from = ( (ben ADJ wais) OR(brewster ADJ think) )" searches for messages from eitherben@wais.com or brewster@think.com.  When you're usingseveral boolean operators, you should always group, todisambiguate how the operators are to be applied.<p><h3>Relevance Ranking</h3>Each document is scored based on its relevance to a user'squestion, where the most relevant document has the highestscore, or rank -- 1000 being the highest, 1 being thelowest. A document receives a higher score if the words inthe question are in the headline, if the words appear manytimes, or if phrases occur as they do in the question. Adocument's score is derived using techniques such as wordweighting, term weighting, proximity relationships, and worddensity. These scoring techniques are outlined below.<p><h3>Proximity Relationships</h3>Proximity relationship scoring specifies that if the wordsin a natural language question are located close together ina document, they are given a higher weight than those foundfurther apart. The idea behind a proximity relationship isthat if a document contains a phrase similar to one in theuser's question, that document is more likely to berelevant.<p><h3>Special Characters</h3>The WAIS server was originally designed to be as general aspossible and, in this spirit, it ignores all characters in adocument that are not either an alphabetical letter or anumber.  In fact, non-alphanumeric characters usuallyseparate words for the parser, for example, "F.Y.I." parsesout to three words.  This rule also applies to queries usedto search a directory of servers.<p><h3>Query Report</h3>A query report is a document created by the waisserverprogram that describes how an end user's question is parsedby the server. When a client process sends a query, theserver creates and returns a query report to the client. Thequery report is the last document in the relevance-rankedlist of documents returned by the server. The headline ofthe query report is listed as 'Query Report for thisSearch', and its relevance score is 1. Since the queryreport is an actual document, it may be retrieved forviewing by the client.<p><strong>The query report contains the following information:</strong><ul>  <li> The database being questioned  <li> The original question  <li> The boolean equivalent of the question in infix    notation. This notation is a fully-parenthesized    version of the question, showing the boolean operator    precedence.  <li> The boolean equivalent of the question displayed as a    tree  <li> The number of documents and the number of words in the    database  <li> The number of unique words in the database  <li> The number of times each word in the question occurred    in the database  <li> The expanded search words resulting from right    truncation  <li> The number of documents found that satisfied the    question  <li>  The amount of elapsed time it took to perform the    search</ul><p>The purpose of this information is to give the user feedbackon how the question was interpreted by the server, and onhow well the information in the database matched the wordsin the question.<p></blockquote><hr><br><br><br><br><a name="browser"><blockquote><H2>Recommended Browsers</H2>Reuters NewsMachine may look and work differently from one browser to another.
