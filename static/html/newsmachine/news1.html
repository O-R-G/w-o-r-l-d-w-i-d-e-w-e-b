He declined to discuss the book but released a statement fromWright saying: "What I believe is that some of them solicited women for themselves."<p>Clinton, who has admitted that there have been "problems" in his marriage in thepast, has denied ever using state troopers to solicit women. <p>Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, has sued Clinton and othersalleging sexual harassment. Jones charges that she had been solicited by a statetrooper who brought her to a hotel room where Clinton sexually propositionedher.<p>The book also goes into the other major issue that dogged Clinton throughout the1992 campaign -- his actions to avoid military service during the Vietnam War.<p>The book traces efforts by Clinton to destroy a 1969 letter he wrote to thedirector of the University of Arkansas ROTC programme, thanking him for "saving"him from the draft.<p>Clinton, then a student at Oxford University, had convinced the director, Col.Eugene Holmes, to grant him a draft deferment after saying he would attend theUniversity of Arkansas Law School on his return from England. <p>Clinton, who eventually went to Yale Law School instead, later wrote a letter toHolmes thanking him for "being so kind and decent" and "for saving me from thedraft."<p>According to the book, Clinton later thought he had succeeded, through intermediaries, in having his letter removed from ROTC files and destroyed --fearing it would undercut his budding political career. <p>In 1991, as Clinton readied for his White House race, aides told him reporterswere asking about the letter. "Don't worry about that," Clinton is quoted assaying, "I've put that one to bed." A copy of the letter later surfaced. <p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1995.
