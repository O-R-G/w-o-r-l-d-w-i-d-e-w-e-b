(Reuter) - For those who believe the personal computer willsoon supplant the TV, the Rolling Stones' live concert broadcast Friday over theInternet computer network offers one message: don't hold your breath. <p>The Stones can boast they are "the greatest rock'n'roll band in cyberspace" nowthat they have become the first group to broadcast a concert live over theglobal web of computer networks.<p>Mick Jagger, himself an "info-freak" according to Rolling Stones spokesman TedMicohis, beamed the first five songs from the band's show at Dallas' Cotton Bowlstadium to anyone with access to high-powered workstations equipped with software to receive video and audio over the Internet. <p>The British rockers are on a sellout tour of North American stadiums. <p>Engineers and software designers can readily appreciate the technological featof such a "multicast" -- cyberspeak for broadcast. But for average rock fans andothers who are simply technologically challenged, the 20 minutes of the RollingStones in cyberspace was hardly riveting. <p>At an Internet viewing site here, about 30 employees and affiliates of thecomputer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. gathered in front of a large screen towatch Jagger and his band members gyrate at eight frames per second and singbarely decipherable tunes.<p>"I went to the Stones concert and let me tell you, watching it at eight framesper second is hardly like seeing them live or at 30 frames a second" on the TV,said Eric Schmidt, chief technology officer at Sun. <p>"But if think people who look at it will understand that they're seeing only thebeginning," he added.<p>"Three or four years from now it'll look and sound better (in digital form) thanon broadcast television," said John Graham, a chief engineer at Sun who workedthrough much of the night to connect Sun's computer systems to the Internet. <p>Sun, based in Mountain View, Calif., a few miles south of here, financED thebroadcast as well as the SunSPARC 10 workstation into which the video feed wasfunnelled.<p>Renditions of "Not Fade Away", "Tumbling Dice", "You Got Me Rocking", "Shattered" and "Rocks Off" were barely recognisable, but Jagger's Britishaccent came through.<p>In the back of the viewing room here, several computer professionals chatteredabout mainframes and workstations while the Stones sang on. <p>"Are we sure this is really live?" asked one sceptical viewer. Schmidt assuredhim it was after hearing Jagger tell the Dallas crowd that the concert was beingbroadcast in cyberspace.<p>After the multicast concert segment ended Sun's Graham called up the 150-oddlabeled Internet "sites" on the projected screen to see what others were sayingabout the concert.<p>"This gives new meaning to the mute button," said one unidentified viewer. <p>While it is impossible to measure how many people watched the Stones' concert onthe Internet, Schmidt estimated the concert could have drawn as many as 500,000"hits," or queries, to the 1,000 to 2,000 servers worldwide that are capable ofsuch a broadcast. Servers store and control the flow of video, audio and otherdata between desktop computers linked on networks. <p>An estimated 20 million people use the Internet. According to the InternetSociety, 56 percent of Internet traffic runs on Sun servers. <p>Thinking Pictures, a New York-based multimedia company, with the help of Sunbrought the Rolling Stones on-line, creating their own electronic "home page" onthe World Wide Web area of the Internet. <p>The band did not receive any payment for the cyberconcert itself. It will usethe broadcast to promote a Nov. 25 pay-per-view concert from Miami. <p>While the Stones are the first band to broadcast a live concert on the Internet,a Seattle-based new age band, "Sky Cries Mary," beat them by a few days inperforming over the vast network in a one-hour studio-based session. <p><p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1994.
