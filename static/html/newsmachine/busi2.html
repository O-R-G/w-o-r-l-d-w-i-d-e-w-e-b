(Reuter) - The nation's largest tobacco companies Monday asked the Florida Supreme Court to prevent the state from going forward with a lawsuit that could cost the industry up to $4.5 billion for smoking related illnesses. <P>Philip Morris Cos. Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. filed papers asking the high court to prohibit the suit under the Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act that they claim is unconstitutional. <P>The Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act, which was passed last April, makes it easier for health officials to sue tobacco manufacturers for Medicaid costs incurred from smoking-related illnesses. <P>Minnesota and Mississippi already have filed suits against the tobacco industry seeking to recoup taxpayers' health-care costs, and Massachusetts also has the legislation to do so. <P>State officials are expected to file the lawsuit Tuesday in a West Palm Beach Circuit Court to recover medical costs and possible punitive damages. <P>Last year, the state paid about $1.4 billion in Medicaid payments for illnesses related to smoking, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration estimates. Under the act, the state can seek triple damages. <P>The tobacco industry, which is already challenging the constitutionality of the law and the agency, is hoping the court will stop or at least put on hold the proceedings. <P>``Our action today is an extraordinary step we did not want to make,'' said Steven Parrish, Philip Morris senior vice president and general counsel said in a statement. ``But, after the State decided to go ahead with its suit, we are left with no choice.'' <P>The tobacco companies claim that the Health Care Administration, a unit of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, is acting illegally as an independent entity. <P>``The Florida Constitution requires that all executive functions be exercised either by the executive department or by an agency under the control and supervision of an executive department,'' said Parrish. ``The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration is neither.'' <P>Transmitted: 95-02-21 06:44:42 EST</blockquote><center><pre><a href="NwsMch.html#front"><img src="front.gif" align=middle border=0></a>    <a href="nws.html"><img src="news.gif" align=middle border=0></a>  <a href="bsnss.html"><img src="busi.gif" align=middle border=0></a>  <a href="sprts.html"><img src="sports.gif" align=middle border=0></a>  <a href="altnws.html"><img src="altnews.gif" align=middle border=0></a> <a href="default.html"><img src="newsse.gif" align=middle border=0></a>  <a href="mynws.html"><img src="mynews.gif" align=middle border=0></a>  <a href="nwstk.html"><img src="newstk.gif" align=middle border=0></a>   <a href="sitemap.html"><img src="sitemap.gif" align=middle border=0></a></pre></center></BODY></HTML>
