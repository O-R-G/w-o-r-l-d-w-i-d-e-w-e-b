"blue helmets" from Croatia.<p>President Franjo Tudjman has said he will not renew a mandate for U.N. forces onhis territory after March 31 and they will have to leave by the end of June. Heargues that their presence merely cements a breakaway Serb state. <p>NATO and U.N. sources say it would not be possible for peacekeepers to stay inBosnia without a presence in Croatia to provide essential back-up. <p>Croatia would also have to allow NATO troops and logistics experts onto itsterritory if the pullout from Bosnia were to take place. <p>The NATO mission to sound out the Croatian government will also try to encourageTudjman to rethink his decision not to extend the existing mandate for UNPROFORforces.<p>"The two things, pullout from Bosnia and any help from Croatia, are intimatelylinked with the withdrawal of peacekeepers from Croatia," said one NATO source.<p>NATO was asked last year to prepare plans to pull out U.N. forces from Bosnia.Fourteen member states, including Germany, said they would provide help, but theexact form this help would take has yet to be decided. <p>"So far, all we have are preliminary commitments," said a NATO source. He saidNATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General George Joulwan, had sincewritten to member states asking for more details of the help they could provide.<p>NATO is under growing pressure to firm up the plans in case Tudjman declines toyield to huge international pressure. U.N. officials also fear that fresh fighting could break out in Bosnia this spring. <p>Originally, the pullout plans were drawn up because of fears that the peacekeepers would be attacked by Serb forces and become embroiled in the Balkanconflict.<p>NATO sources again stressed final approval for the pullout plan, which couldinvolve up to 45,000 troops, would not come for several more weeks and repeatedthe alliance's position that it hopes withdrawal never takes place. <p>"Our view is - like everybody's - that we hope this never becomes necessary.This is contingency planning," one source said. <p>NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes told a Belgian financial newspaper in aninterview published on Wednesday that, if the alliance were asked, it would beable to carry out the withdrawal in what would be the biggest military operationever launched in peacetime Europe.<p>Alliance sources said the operation would be under NATO command, but the exactstructure still had to be agreed with the U.N. mission which includes severalnon-NATO countries.<p>There was also no agreement on who would pay for the operation, which could costmillions of dollars.<p>"Technically, it should be the United Nations because they are requested theoperation, but -- they are broke," said a senior NATO diplomat. "NATO is notprepared to foot the bill, so?"<p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1995.
