High losses were inevitable, he said. <p>"We cannot fail to notice the inadequate and hasty reaction of a string ofpolitical activists and organisations, practically calling for a freeze onpolitical and economic cooperation with Russia," Karasin said. <p>"But we note with sorrow rhetoric calling to mind the recent very sad past ofour relationship with the West. We observe a syndrome, a reflex reaction and areturn to old stereotypes in reacting to events in our country." <p>Karasin specifically referred to the indefinite suspension on Tuesday of examination of Russia's request for membership of the 33-nation Council ofEurope. Members of the Council, which serves as a watchdog for human rights inEurope, expressed "grave concern" at developments in Chechnya. <p>Karasin said Russia viewed human rights as "one of the most important aspects ofevents. We do not close our eyes to this". <p>"But it must be clear that the scale of the crisis with which Russia is grappling in Chechnya made human tragedy and losses practically inevitable," hesaid.<p>He said the Kremlin noted with satisfaction that most of its Western partners"demonstrated a balanced approach, and that they support maintaining Russia'sterritorial integrity".<p>Western countries have gradually abandoned their initial reluctance to criticiseRussia as the scale of fighting and casualties has grown. <p>French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on Thursday that the European Unionwould complain to Russia about its broken promises to keep a ceasefire and startnew talks on the future of Chechnya.<p>Jesse Helms, the new head of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saidon Wednesday Russia risked losing U.S. foreign aid if the "brutality" continuedin Chechnya.<p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1995.
