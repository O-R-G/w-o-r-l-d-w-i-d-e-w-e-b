Newt is an ethical violation. His limited views of society and what it should be restrict free thought by imposing artificial mores. His rhetoric ridicules the thoughts of anybody that is not in what he defines as the mainstream.<b><font size=2>Maxwell_Klinger@Toledo.net</font></b><p>Democrat Ben Jones filed a seven-count complaint against the Republican leaderasking the committee to investigate. He also said precedent calls for it to namean outside counsel to probe the charges.<b><font size=2>Hawkeye@mash:4077.com</font></b><p>But that complaint went unresolved by the ethics committee in the prior Democratic-controlled Congress. Like then, the ethics committee makeup is splitbetween Republicans, who now control Congress for the first time in 40 years,and Democrats with seven members each.Gingrich improperly used official House resources and violated tax law to finance a college course Gingrich teaches in Georgia, a course Jones said wasdesigned to advance Gingrich's partisan political goals.Jones' new, amended complaint charges Gingrich "has violated rules, statutes of conduct" and extends to a book arrangement between Gingrich and HarperCollins, a publishing firm controlled by media magnate RupertMurdoch.<b><font size=2>FBurns@interport.net</font></b><p>A spokesman for Gingrich, Tony Blankley, dismissed the complaint. He told Reuters that "it appears Mr. Jones, whom Newt thrashed in the election, isfeasting on a bunch of sour grapes." He added that Jones has established "apattern of filing frivolous ethics complaints against Newt" and expects more "asMr. Jones' creative juices flow from time to time." <b><font size=2>HotLips@seoul.korea.panix.com</font></b><p>He also said precedent calls for it to name an outside counsel to probe the charges.<b><font size=2>Hawkeye@mash:4077.com</font></b><p>Gingrich improperly used official House resources and violated tax law to finance a college course Gingrich teaches in Georgia, a course Jones said wasdesigned to advance Gingrich's partisan political goals.Jones' new, amended complaint charges Gingrich "has violated rules, statutes of conduct" and extends to a book arrangement between Gingrich and HarperCollins, a publishing firm controlled by media magnate RupertMurdoch.<b><font size=2>FBurns@interport.net</font></b><p>A spokesman for Gingrich, Tony Blankley, dismissed the complaint.
