We are going to be sensitive to regional viewers," a spokeswoman for Ted Turner's TNT & Cartoon Network said ina recent interview.<p>Blanket broadcasting and Western tastes do not always go over well in Asia, aregion filled with races, religion, culture and languages as diverse as thosefound in Europe.<p>Rupert Murdoch, whose STAR TV pioneered Asian satellite broadcasting in 1991,should know.<p>This month STAR announced its pop-music "Channel V" was finally blessed by theSingapore government, well-known for its tight grip on the media. <p>But no nudity, rap or grunge will be seen on Singapore's eight hours of STAR TVpop videos each week. STAR has substantially tamed its music broadcasts from itsearly days to include more crooning love songs and less rock 'n' roll. <p>"We vet everything for not just vulgarity and sex and violence but also forcultural taboos," said Channel V programme manager Don Atyeo. <p>"It's a real myth that music travels across boundaries," Atyeo said. "It's veryhard for a kid in (Hong Kong's working-class area of) Mong Kok to relate toMadonna prancing around with traffic cones on her tits. They relate more to AndyLau with a sports coat and a turtleneck sweater." <p>Murdoch also yielded to China, axing STAR TV's BBC news broadcasts over northAsia last year when Communist officials found uncensored Western news too closeto the bone.<p>While Western broadcasters were rethinking their Asian strategies, niche localbroadcasters began to spring up, promising sanitised family-style entertainmentto please Asia's increasingly wealthy but relatively conservative middle class.<p>Asian television veteran Robert Chua started China Entertainment TelevisionBroadcast Ltd (CETV), a variety satellite channel in the main Chinese dialect ofMandarin.<p>Former Hong Kong publisher Yu Pun-hoi launched Chinese Television Network, whichplans to show Mandarin news and entertainment. <p>But Western broadcasters say they can still use their popular material and playto their strengths in Asia, as long as they give the locals in each country whatthey want.<p>Ted Turner has archives full of movies about making money, a favourite localpastime.<p>This Lunar New Year holiday while Asia's Chinese viewers are wishing each othergood fortune they will be bombarded with movies about wealth and getting rich.Cartoons will feature poor little rich kid Richie Rich. <p>Advertisers, too, after their experience in Europe, find generic ads rarely havepan-Asia appeal, even for universal brands. <p>Companies planning regional television campaigns mostly buy time on local terrestrial television stations, often creating a different ad for each country.<p>"There's no such place as Asia. India is a very different place to Malaysia anda very different place to China," said television researcher John Kaye. "Pan-Asian advertising is as daft a proposition as pan-European advertisingwas."<p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1995.
