Kennedy airports were ordered closed earlySaturday, but reopened after six to eight hours respectively providing limitedservices. By early afternoon one of JFK's four runways and one of La Guardia'stwo runways were operational.<p>New Jersey's Newark airport remained open throughout the night but had limitedarrival and departure services. Air traffic was snarled at Philadelphia International Airport.<p>Boston's Logan Airport was closed early on Saturday afternoon but was expectedto open later in the day. Baltimore-Washington International was operating onlyone of its four runways, an airport spokeswoman said. <p>Forecasters had given plenty of advance warning about the storm, promptingfrenzied shoppers to jam area supermarkets Friday to stock up on food. Authorities in many cities contracted for additional snowplows to battle thestorm.<p>New York City officially had nine inches (23 cm) of snow, which by mid-day hadturned to rain.<p>City officials placed 3,000 sanitation workers on alert to continuously operate1,850 snowplows and spreaders in an attempt to keep primary roads passable totraffic.<p>They appealed to people to stay home and keep warm. Those who had to go out wereurged to use mass transit.<p>Snow depths reached over one foot (30 cm) north and west of Philadelphia, withdrifts at least twice as deep. An area between Philadelphia and New York washardest hit, with Princeton, New Jersey hit by 16 inches (40 cm), Candor said.<p>In Washington D.C., heavy overnight snows dumped up to eight inches (20 cm) innorthern suburbs.<p>Heavy snow accumulation was also reported in metropolitan Boston by noon, andforecasters said the problem would worsen before the storm ended by late afternoon.<p><P>(c) Reuters Limited 1995.
